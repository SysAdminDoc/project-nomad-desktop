## What Makes This Different

- **Situation-Aware AI** — The AI knows your actual inventory levels, burn rates, recent incidents, and threat status. It gives advice based on YOUR specific situation.
- **Complete Command Center** — Not just a content library. Full tactical operations with SITREP generator, threat assessment matrix, comms log, incident timeline, and emergency broadcast.
- **Comprehensive Knowledge Base** — START triage, companion planting, calorie density database, livestock care, WHO essential medicines, wild edible plants, survival knots, navigation, water purification, sanitation, COMSEC, and more — all embedded and available offline.
- **Night Vision Mode** — Red-on-black theme that preserves scotopic vision during darkness operations. Auto-switches at sunset.
- **LAN Chat** — Everyone on your local WiFi can message each other through the dashboard. No internet needed.
- **Nuclear Effects Simulator** — Bundled NukeMap with blast radius, thermal, fallout, and casualty modeling for nuclear preparedness planning.
- **Printable Emergency Cards** — Wallet-size cards with medical info, contacts, rally points, and quick reference protocols.
